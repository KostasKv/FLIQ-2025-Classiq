    "# Defining a Quantum Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will create a QML model for classifying the quantum phases. This will include 3 stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   First, you will need to decide on the data encoding scheme, i.e. loading numerical features you obtained above into the quantum circuit.\n",
    "-   Then, you will need to come up with an ansatz - a parametrized quantum circuit, which will be optimized to perform classification.\n",
    "-   Finally, to readout classical information from the quantum model, you will need to perform some sort of measurement on the resultant quantum state. Perhaps, you could extract an expectation value of some Pauli-string $P \\in \\{I, X, Y, Z\\}^{\\otimes N}$, so that $\\langle P \\rangle < b$ is interpreted as $Z2$ and $\\langle P \\rangle > b$ is interpreted as $Z3$ for some decision boundary $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to QML in Classiq, linked below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find the following guides useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   QML with Classiq: http://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/read/qml_with_classiq_guide/\n",
    "-   Variational Model Example: https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library/blob/main/algorithms/qaoa/maxcut/qaoa_max_cut.ipynb\n",
    "-   Hybrid QNN: https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/algorithms/qml/hybrid_qnn/hybrid_qnn_for_subset_majority/\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the 2nd guide describes a hybrid model, **you may not implement a hybrid model**, the guide should only be used as a reference as to how to implement QML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning**: Training using the Classiq PyTorch integration may take a prohibitive amount of time. Consider this when choosing an approach.\n"
